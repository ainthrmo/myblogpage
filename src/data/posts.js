    title: 'How I Started Learning Programming (And Why I Almost Gave Up)',
    excerpt:
      `I wasn’t sure if coding was for me at first. It started off casually—just something I tried out here and there, not fully committed but curious. It was like sketching on a blank page—no clear direction, just experimenting and seeing where it went. I wasn’t expecting much, but then I experienced that one moment that every programmer has—a “Hello, World!” moment. It was like drawing the first few lines of a sketch and realizing, “Hey, this actually looks like something!” That moment made me realize that coding, like sketching, is a process of discovery. The excitement of seeing my first lines of code actually produce a result was magical, and I wanted to learn more. 

    Just like sketching, programming involves starting with simple strokes or concepts, and then gradually building something greater. Each line of code, like each pencil stroke, is part of the creative journey. In sketching, you refine your lines, add more detail, and adjust your drawing until it starts to take shape. Similarly, with programming, you write your code, debug it, and iterate until it works.

    That moment made me realize something very important when it comes to learning: you have to find the fun in it. Whether you're sketching a doodle or coding your first app, the process itself needs to be enjoyable. It’s easy to get bogged down by frustration or obstacles, but if you can find something exciting about what you’re doing—even the smallest wins—it fuels your curiosity and keeps you going. For me, the thrill of seeing a result for the first time was like finishing a sketch and saying, “This is just the beginning!” It’s that sense of discovery and the joy of creating something new that keeps me motivated to learn and grow in programming, just like it does in sketching.`,
