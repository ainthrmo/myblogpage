  about:
     `I won’t bore you with the usual intro—I’m just a regular person with a bit of a procrastination problem. It’s probably not the most exciting thing to hear, but I find interest in almost everything I do. Whether it’s programming, building a business, or just figuring out life, I get excited by new things—even if it takes me a little extra time to dive in.

I’m from a downtown city, and my full name is Eaindra Moe, but I prefer to go by Ainn since it’s much easier for most people to pronounce. I’ve been learning to code for a few years now, and I’m currently focused on building in public and sharing my journey as I go. I’m not an expert by any means, but I’m always eager to learn and grow.`,
